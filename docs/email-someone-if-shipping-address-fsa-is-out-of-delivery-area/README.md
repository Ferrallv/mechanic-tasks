## Documentation

This checks an order and sends an email to someone if the shipping address FSA isn't included in the FSA list.

The FSA list must be comprised of FSAs in the format 'A1A', without the quotation marks. The FSAs must be seperated by commas and no spaces. The FSAs can be entered in any order.

The task will log orders whose FSA was was found in the available FSA list.

It also displays the available FSA list in json format to more easily catch if there were errors in inputting the availability list.
